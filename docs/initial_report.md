# P2P Initial Report

## Information

Team name: NSE-5

GitLab repository: [`NSE-5`](https://gitlab.lrz.de/netintum/teaching/p2psec_projects_2022/NSE-5)

Names of team members:

 - Christian Plass (`ge96raf`)
 - Luis Kleinheinz (`ge96cek`)

Chosen module: NSE

## Implementation

As for our implementation we chose the **GNUnet NSE** algorithm, as described in the lecture.

Even though other implementations like **Gossip** could provide a more accurate estimate, one key focus of the project should also be it's resistance to potential attacks or malicious participants, which is not the case for **Gossip** or **Sampling**. As the **GNUnet NSE** algorithm has a **proof of work** algorithm implemented, it secures itself against many attacks like **denial of service**.

Futhermore it provides better runtimes for many aspects, as stated in the lecture slides. Therefore we think the GNUnet algorithm is the best choice for our project.

## OS & Programming Language

We choose **GNU+Linux** as target operating system because it's free software with a huge documentation, preferably Debian GNU/Linux as distribution.
Furthermore, it's the OS of our personal laptops and servers, so we are most familiar with it.

For the implementation language we choose **Python3** (at least v3.9) because of the great big standard library, as well as it's ease of development.
We know of certain limitations of that language, e.g. the slow speed (compared to for example C++ or Rust) and no strictly enforced type system.

## Build system

Build systems are not required for Python, as the language is interpreted instead of compiled.

## Intended measures to guarantee quality of software

1. Enforcing code review of newly written (and tested) code by the other team member before merging feature branches into the master branch (this can be configured in repository settings).
2. Checking the code base with `pylint` and `flake8` to see violations of PEP-8 and some lighter forms of bad coding style.
3. Testing every commit with the self-written unittests using the `unittest` module.
    This should be done for every important code block to achieve a relatively high code coverage (almost 100% would be very nice, but 80% is still pretty good).
    We may even build some full end-to-end tests with full sample networks, but that's a question of available time and effort.

## Available libraries to assist in our project

Generally, the Python Standard Library is great and huge.
It's not clear yet which libraries exactly we need to use from the available ones.
Some of the modules we currently think of for our project are:

 - `os` and `sys` for generic OS & system utils
 - `typing` for typing annotations
 - `logging` for logging
 - `argparse` and `configparser` for CLI handling and configuration parsing
 - `socket`, `socketserver` and `struct` for networking tasks and data (un)packing
 - `asyncio` for asynchronous event loop support (contains networking utils, too)

We currently don't plan to use third-party libraries for the core implementation.
However, if we needed to, we would search for them on PyPI to use `pip` as our package manager.
One such example is `sqlalchemy`, which would provide us with a pretty simple to use ORM for persistent data storage (most probably with SQLite as its backend).

## License for your projectâ€™s software

[AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) since it's the strongest copyleft license out there (we would go for GPLv3 if this wasn't a network service).
It allows anyone to read, edit, study and redistribute our code under the same license while prohibiting closed-source software builds.

We found this to be the most adequate licence for our project, as it should be an open-source software for testing and understanding P2P-networks and the NSE algorithm in detail. Therefore anyone should be able to read and redistribute the code for demonstration or study purposes, but not for private closed-source systems.

## Previous programming experience

1. Luis (4. Bachelor Informatics)
    - Fluent in Java
    - Capable of C# and C
    - Currently no major Python experience, yet
2. Chris (4. Bachelor Informatics)
    - Very fluent in Python
    - Capable of Java and C++
    - Experienced in developing network services ([example](https://github.com/hopfenspace/MateBot))
    - Working as a system administrator for a small company from Pfaffenhofen a.d. Ilm, participated in the Bachelor practical course _Systemadministration_
    - GitHub: https://github.com/CrsiX

## Planned workload distribution

The goal is to achieve relatively equally distributed workloads.
However, as Luis is not that experienced in Python yet, he may work more on documenting and testing, while Chris may work more on developing. Eventually both team members should have participated in all parts of the project nonetheless.
Design choices should always be discussed with both team members so there are no missunderstanding among the team.
Of course, the code base and program logic should be understood by both team members, otherwise documenting or testing wouldn't be reasonable possible.
